<a class="header" href="print.html#stage-one-mimicry-模仿阶段" id="stage-one-mimicry-模仿阶段"><h2>STAGE ONE: MIMICRY 模仿阶段</h2></a>
<p><strong>In Stage One, we learn to fit in with the people and culture around us.</strong>
The goal of Stage One is to teach us how to function within society so that we can be autonomous, self-sufficient adults.</p>
<p>As children, the way we’re wired to learn is by watching and mimicking others.
First we learn to do physical skills like walk and talk.
Then we develop social skills by watching and mimicking our peers around us.
Then, finally, in late childhood, we learn to adapt to our culture by observing the rules and norms around us and trying to behave in such a way that is generally considered acceptable by society.</p>
<p>In Stage One, a person is wholly dependent on other people’s actions and approval to be happy.
This is a horrible strategy because other people are unpredictable and unreliable.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#stage-two-self-discovery-自我发现阶段" id="stage-two-self-discovery-自我发现阶段"><h2>STAGE TWO: SELF-DISCOVERY 自我发现阶段</h2></a>
<p><strong>Stage Two is about learning what makes us different from the people and culture around us.</strong>
Stage Two requires us to begin making decisions for ourselves, to test ourselves, and to understand ourselves and what makes us unique.</p>
<p>Stage Two involves a lot of trial-and-error and experimentation. We experiment with living in new places, hanging out with new people, imbibing new substances, and playing with new people’s orifices.
At some point we all must admit the inevitable: life is short, not all of our dreams can come true, so we should carefully pick and choose what we have the best shot at and commit to it.</p>
<p>In Stage Two, one becomes reliant on oneself, but they’re still reliant on external success to be happy — making money, accolades, victory, conquests, etc.
These are more controllable than other people, but they are still mostly unpredictable in the long-run.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#stage-three-commitment-自我实现阶段" id="stage-three-commitment-自我实现阶段"><h2>STAGE THREE: COMMITMENT 自我实现阶段</h2></a>
<p>Stage Three is the great consolidation of one’s life. Stage Three is all about maximizing your own potential in this life.</p>
<p>It’s all about building your legacy. What will you leave behind when you’re gone? What will people remember you by?
Whether that’s a breakthrough study or an amazing new product or an adoring family, <strong>Stage Three is about leaving the world a little bit different than the way you found it.</strong></p>
<p>Stage Three relies on a handful of relationships and endeavors that proved themselves resilient and worthwhile through Stage Two. These are more reliable.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#stage-four-legacy-遗产保护阶段" id="stage-four-legacy-遗产保护阶段"><h2>STAGE FOUR: LEGACY 遗产保护阶段</h2></a>
<p>People arrive into Stage Four having spent somewhere around half a century investing themselves in what they believed was meaningful and important.</p>
<p>They did great things, worked hard, earned everything they have, maybe started a family or a charity or a political or cultural revolution or two, and now they’re done.
They’ve reached the age where their energy and circumstances no longer allow them to pursue their purpose any further.
The goal of Stage Four then becomes not to create a legacy as much as simply making sure that legacy lasts beyond one’s death.</p>
<p>As humans, we have a deep need to feel as though our lives mean something.
This meaning we constantly search for is literally our only psychological defense against the incomprehensibility of this life and the inevitability of our own death.</p>
<p><strong>Stage Four requires we only hold on to what we’ve already accomplished as long as possible.</strong></p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#how-to-enter-the-next-stage-怎样进入下一个阶段" id="how-to-enter-the-next-stage-怎样进入下一个阶段"><h2>How To Enter The Next Stage 怎样进入下一个阶段</h2></a>
<p>The same thing gets us stuck at every stage: a sense of personal inadequacy.</p>
<p>The solution at each stage is then backwards. To move beyond Stage One, you must accept that you will never be enough for everybody all the time, and therefore you must make decisions for yourself.</p>
<p>To move beyond Stage Two, you must accept that you will never be capable of accomplishing everything you can dream and desire, and therefore you must zero in on what matters most and commit to it.</p>
<p>To move beyond Stage Three, you must realize that time and energy are limited, and therefore you must refocus your attention to helping others take over the meaningful projects you began.</p>
<p>To move beyond Stage Four, you must realize that change is inevitable, and that the influence of one person, no matter how great, no matter how powerful, no matter how meaningful, will eventually dissipate too.</p>
<p>And life will go on.</p>
<p>At each subsequent stage, happiness becomes based more on internal, controllable values and less on the externalities of the ever-changing outside world. Later stages don’t replace previous stages. They transcend them.</p>
<p>Stage Two people still care about social approval. They just care about something more than social approval.</p>
<p>Stage Three people still care about testing their limits. They just care more about the commitments they’ve made.</p>
<p><strong>Each stage represents a reshuffling of one’s life priorities.</strong></p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#the-four-types-of-happy-lives-幸福的四个层次" id="the-four-types-of-happy-lives-幸福的四个层次"><h1>The Four Types Of Happy Lives 幸福的四个层次</h1></a>
<p>There are four types of happy lives, the lives get better — but more challenging.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#happy-life-1-the-pleasant-life-愉快的生活" id="happy-life-1-the-pleasant-life-愉快的生活"><h2>Happy Life #1: The Pleasant Life 愉快的生活</h2></a>
<blockquote>
<p>A life that successfully pursues the positive emotions about the present, past and future.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The goal is life as one long vacation. You want as many positive feelings and bodily pleasures as you can. Tasty food, aesthetic feeling, smiles, massages, and laughs. No regrets, no worries, and a head full of positive thoughts.</p>
<p>Research shows that often you don’t actually do what you enjoy the most — you do what is easiest. So you need to schedule pleasurable things.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#happy-life-2-the-good-life-美好的生活" id="happy-life-2-the-good-life-美好的生活"><h2>Happy Life #2: The Good Life 美好的生活</h2></a>
<blockquote>
<p>Using your signature strengths to obtain abundant gratification in the main realms of your life.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Actively doing stuff you’re good at and getting lost in it. Trying to improve your skills. Accomplishing goals and trying to achieve “flow” as much as possible.
Flow is when you’re working at something and you’re in the zone, not noticing the passage of time because you’re caught up in the activity.</p>
<p>While The Pleasant Life is all about feeling, The Good Life is focused on doing.
And much like The Pleasant Life, The Good Life can still be meaningless. Video games are great at creating flow and devoting yourself to becoming the best player of a game.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#happy-life-3-the-meaningful-life-有意义的生活" id="happy-life-3-the-meaningful-life-有意义的生活"><h2>Happy Life #3: The Meaningful Life 有意义的生活</h2></a>
<blockquote>
<p>Using your signature strengths and virtues in service of something larger than you are.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Meaningful Life is The Good Life — but you’re using your signature strengths in a way that benefits others as well as yourself.</p>
<p>Work of expert quality that benefits the broader society consistently exhibit high levels of job satisfaction.</p>
<p>You have to care to have meaning in your life. And that’s going to mean occasional un-pleasant feelings: Meaningful involvements increase one’s stress, worries, arguments, and anxiety, which reduce happiness.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#happy-life-4-the-full-life-完整的生活" id="happy-life-4-the-full-life-完整的生活"><h2>Happy Life #4: The Full Life 完整的生活</h2></a>
<blockquote>
<p>Take all of the previous three in moderation and you have The Full Life.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A full life consists in experiencing positive emotions about the past and future, savoring positive feelings from the pleasures,
deriving abundant gratification from your signature strengths, and using these strengths in the service of something larger to obtain meaning.</p>
<p>It requires you deeply committed to lifelong goals and ambitions. It can be a lot to juggle. It’s tricky to stay consistent. You have to find a balance that works for you.
But as the happiest people in the world know: it’s worth it.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#the-meaning-of-life-人生的意义" id="the-meaning-of-life-人生的意义"><h1>The Meaning Of Life 人生的意义</h1></a>
<a class="header" href="print.html#为什么要过有意义的人生" id="为什么要过有意义的人生"><h2>为什么要过有意义的人生？</h2></a>
<p>You don’t become happy by pursuing happiness. You become happy by living a life that means something. </p>
<p>People commit suicide not because they’re unhappy but because they lack meaning.
Kids are really expensive and don’t make parents happier, but children bring enormous meaning to people’s lives.</p>
<p>The happy feelings faded fast. Over the long term, pursuing meaning actually boosted psychological health.</p>
<p>Today, right now, is the best time ever to choose to do something that truly matters. Something meaningful to you. That ONE thing that makes you create value that means a lot to you. Something you alone can share with the rest of us.</p>
<p>Pursuing meaning makes you feel good about yourself, because you are pursuing something bigger than yourself.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#怎样让人生变得有意义" id="怎样让人生变得有意义"><h2>怎样让人生变得有意义？</h2></a>
<p>You won’t discover your life’s work by wondering or worrying about it. And it doesn’t come fully formed. You’ll discover it by taking action, everyday.
By looking at what is working and what isn’t, you can align yourself with your why and what or the passion and purpose for your life.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Belonging</strong>. 归属感</li>
</ol>
<p>Quickest way to add meaning to your life is to belong to a group.</p>
<p>People with the happiest lives were “takers.” But those with the most meaningful lives were “givers.”
As we saw, happiness isn’t everything. Parenthood is the ultimate form of giving. And givers lead meaningful lives.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong>Purpose</strong>. 目的性</li>
</ol>
<p>Purpose is less about what you do and more about how you see what you do.</p>
<p>One of the best ways to derive fulfilment as an employee is to work on projects you initiate. Something you are responsible for.
If you can take more initiates and implement a lot of your own ideas, instead of reacting to actions others expect of you, your chances of finding fulfilment could double.</p>
<p>You need something that motivates you and that you can organize your actions around.
How can you redefine your role at work to find more meaning? What’s a bigger goal it contributes to? How does it better the lives of others?</p>
<p>WHY you pursue something is as equally important as WHAT you pursue.
Purpose eases the pain of the long hours and gives you the fortitude to fail. It makes menial tasks meaningful and even fulfilling.</p>
<p>Finding (and doing) what makes you come alive changes everything.
Pursue something so important that even if you fail, the world is better off with you having tried.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li><strong>Storytelling</strong>. 叙事性</li>
</ol>
<p>You have a story you tell yourself about your life — whether you realize it or not.</p>
<p>Human brain is wired for stories. It’s how you make sense of the world.
Narrative identity as an internalized story you create about yourself — your own personal myth.
In redemption stories, the protagonists move from suffering to salvation — they experience a negative event followed by a positive event that resulted from the negative event and therefore gives their suffering some meaning.</p>
<p>You rarely get to change the world, but you can change your internal story.
Beyond stories of redemption, people who believe their lives are meaningful tend to tell stories defined by growth, communion and agency.</p>
<p>Try to divide your live into chapters and to recount key scenes, such as a high point, a low point, a turning point or an early memory.
Try think about personal beliefs and values and to reflect on your story’s central theme.</p>
<p>A psychotherapist’s job is to work with patients to rewrite their stories in a more positive way.
Even making smaller story edits to our personal narratives can have a big impact on our lives.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li><strong>Transcendence</strong>. 超越感</li>
</ol>
<p>Awe Nature and Love Life.</p>
<p>Sometimes life feels so small. You’re all-in on that one thing and now that thing is gone. It’s absolutely crushing.
But there are experiences that provide that feeling of just how big and amazing life is. The secret is a little word with big impact: awe.
Get out in nature and nature makes your big problems seem tiny.
Looking at the night sky, bright stars who don't admire infinite universe? however, only the wise man fearing the true God who created the universe.</p>
<p>Life can be hard. But remember, while the difficult moments may decrease happiness, they’re essential for building meaning. And that’s what matters in the long run.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#信念" id="信念"><h1>信念</h1></a>
<a class="header" href="print.html#be-your-best-self-做最好的自己" id="be-your-best-self-做最好的自己"><h2>Be your best self. 做最好的自己</h2></a>
<p>Be yourself; no base imitator of another, but your best self. There is something which you can do better than another.
Listen to the inward voice and bravely obey that. Do the things at which you are great, not what you were never made for.</p>
<p>Something you are happy to do without hesitation. Skills that are unique to you.
Skills you can only learn by doing; by learning how to fly after jumping off the cliff.</p>
<p>Invest in yourself, it’s the best investment you can ever make. Create a bigger version of yourself.
There is something about you that can be explored and developed to your benefit and the rest of the world.
The real world rewards those who get stuff done!</p>
<p>You have decided to ignore everybody and focus on building the life you deeply care about.
Don’t be afraid to expose your authentic self to the world, be creative about what you do.
Show your work. Don’t be afraid to show others what you are capable of.
Become immune to the impact of others’ opinion and stand naked in a crowd of ideas; comfortable in knowing that while others married the mundane, you explored the exceptional.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#your-thoughts-decide-your-future-你的想法决定你的未来" id="your-thoughts-decide-your-future-你的想法决定你的未来"><h2>Your thoughts decide your future. 你的想法决定你的未来</h2></a>
<p>We attract into our lives by what we think and believe.
Writing out you are being who you want to be, which will then inform what you do and ultimately who you become.</p>
<p>No matter where you are right now, you can have any future you want.
Create the highest, grandest vision possible for your life, because you become what you believe.
Mental creation always precedes physical creation. The blueprint you design in your head becomes the life you build.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#assume-nothing-but-question-everything-怀疑一切" id="assume-nothing-but-question-everything-怀疑一切"><h2>Assume nothing but question everything. 怀疑一切</h2></a>
<p>You desperate for knowledge or information that can be used to improve or create something.
While others waste time, you rather learn how to create, build or design something.
You are hungry to make a difference or do something significant.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#dont-invest-in-a-career-build-a-life-创造属于自己的人生" id="dont-invest-in-a-career-build-a-life-创造属于自己的人生"><h2>Don’t invest in a career. Build a life. 创造属于自己的人生</h2></a>
<p>The way we work keeps changing. Robots are eating jobs. People are scared of losing their jobs. Nobody is safe.
It’s easier to transform your passion into your job than finding a job that matches your what you love to do.
Do something interesting, meaningful, different, amazing and truly remarkable. Show your most amazing work to the world.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#take-your-dreams-seriously-认真对待你的梦想" id="take-your-dreams-seriously-认真对待你的梦想"><h2>Take your dreams seriously. 认真对待你的梦想</h2></a>
<p>If you pursue your dreams long enough, compounding takes effect. Momentum will surge. Don’t give up just yet.
For centuries we’ve been trained by the system to stop thinking and do as we are told.
But dreamers and thinkers are changing the world as we know it.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#nothing-is-impossible-一切皆有可能" id="nothing-is-impossible-一切皆有可能"><h2>Nothing is impossible. 一切皆有可能</h2></a>
<p>You need to aim beyond what you are capable of.
You need to develop a complete disregard for where your abilities end.
Make your vision of where you want to be a reality.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#becoming-successful-走向成功" id="becoming-successful-走向成功"><h1>Becoming Successful 走向成功</h1></a>
<p>Don’t aim at success. The more you aim at it and make it a target, the more you are going to miss it.
For success, like happiness, cannot be pursued; it must ensue, you have to let it happen by not caring about it.
I want you to listen to what your conscience commands you to do and go on to carry it out to the best of your knowledge.
Then you will live to see that in the long-run, success will follow you precisely because you had forgotten to think about it.</p>
<p>I know so many people who chase whatever worked for other people.
Those who are going to succeed will decide what they want to do regardless of what everyone else says or thinks about it.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#believe-in-life-long-learning-终身学习" id="believe-in-life-long-learning-终身学习"><h2>Believe in life-long learning. 终身学习</h2></a>
<p>One of the best ways to gain knowledge and be better is self-education.
As long as you are genuinely interested in the topic, don’t stop.
Lifelong learning will get most of your questions answered.
Make the most of your time and improve yourself every day.</p>
<p>The ability to expand your mind and strive for lifelong learning is more critical to your success than you think.
Every skill you acquire doubles your odds of success. 
Begin to plant seeds every day that will yield the best and most fulfilling life now and in the future.</p>
<p>Research has proven that more than ever before, a challenged, stimulated brain may well be the key to a vibrant later life.
Studies have found that learning throughout our lives can improve self-esteem and increase life-satisfaction, optimism and belief in our own abilities.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#leverage-your-position-立足现状" id="leverage-your-position-立足现状"><h2>Leverage Your Position. 立足现状</h2></a>
<p>There are people you already know who have information you need.
There are people you already know who have capital you can use.
There are people you already know who can connect you with people you should know.
Instead of wanting more, how about you utilize what you already have? Until you do, more won’t help you.</p>
<p>Success is based on having and maintaining a motivation worth fighting for.
It’s based on believing what others might call a fantasy.
It’s based on leveraging your position and maintaining the momentum of every step you take.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#begin-with-the-end-clearly-in-mind-以终为始" id="begin-with-the-end-clearly-in-mind-以终为始"><h2>Begin with the end clearly in mind. 以终为始</h2></a>
<p>People may spend their whole lives climbing the ladder of success only to find, once they reach the top, that the ladder is leaning against the wrong wall.</p>
<p>Too many people are playing the wrong game. It’s how you ruin your life without even knowing it.
More important than playing “the game” is how the game is set up. How you set up the game determines how you play. And it’s better to win first, then play.</p>
<p>Start from the end and work backwards. Rather than thinking about what’s plausible, or what’s expected, or what makes sense — start with what you want.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#dont-wait-to-start-立即行动" id="dont-wait-to-start-立即行动"><h2>Don’t Wait To Start. 立即行动</h2></a>
<p>You qualify yourself by showing up and working. You get permission by deciding.</p>
<p>Life is short. Don’t wait for tomorrow for something you could do today.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#take-one-step-at-a-time-走一步看一步" id="take-one-step-at-a-time-走一步看一步"><h2>Take one step at a time. 走一步看一步</h2></a>
<p>When you’re trying to accomplish something big, you have the why but rarely the how. The path to achieving your goals is far from obvious.
The emotional need for clarity and fear of the unknown leads people to abandon their dreams for more straightforward pursuits.
However you don't need to have “it all” figured it. You need clarity on the next step or two.
When you get to the next step, you’ll be able to ask better questions.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#create-as-you-see-fit-以自己的方式做事" id="create-as-you-see-fit-以自己的方式做事"><h2>Create As You See Fit. 以自己的方式做事</h2></a>
<p>There is no right or wrong way. Rather, it’s about doing things your way.
You’ll emerge with your own voice and original work. You’ll be less troubled about how your work is received and more focused on creating something you believe in.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#dont-fear-to-break-convention-敢于打破常规" id="dont-fear-to-break-convention-敢于打破常规"><h2>Don’t Fear To Break Convention. 敢于打破常规</h2></a>
<p>Convention is where we’re at. Breaking convention is how we’ll evolve, which requires a gargantuan quantity of failure.</p>
<p>Failure is feedback. Failure is moving forward. It’s conscious and exerted effort toward something you’ve never done before. It’s incredible.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#never-forget-where-you-came-from-不忘根本" id="never-forget-where-you-came-from-不忘根本"><h2>Never Forget Where You Came From. 不忘根本</h2></a>
<p>It’s easy to forget where you came from.
It’s easy to forget all the sacrifices other people have made to get you where you are.
Humility, gratitude, and recognition of your blessings keeps your success in proper perspective.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#no-one-succeeds-alone-没有人能独自成功" id="no-one-succeeds-alone-没有人能独自成功"><h2>No One Succeeds Alone. 没有人能独自成功</h2></a>
<p>&quot;Find Your Tribe&quot; — No matter how talented, how successful, how brilliant you are, just remember: Nobody wins alone.</p>
<p>You cannot be successful in a big way alone. You need help. You need an audience. It does not matter what your dream is.
You can only maximise your strengths and where you fall short, you need others’ strengths to create something truly amazing.
Nobody exists in a vacuum — and nobody succeeds in one either.</p>
<p>Pay very close attention to the people around you.
We don’t live and work in isolation, and when you can take advantage of the wisdom and even failings of those around you, the climb toward success is made that much easier.
Are you surrounding yourself with the right people? Are you putting yourself in the right environment? Are you getting inspired and challenged by the best people?
You can be the reason others receive inspiration. Show your best work every day!</p>

<p>If you study the life and work trajectory of experts, two patterns seem to emerge.
One, they have specific backgrounds or opportunities, as mentioned above. Two, they put an incredible amount of time and effort into deliberate, effortful practice.</p>
<p>The best type of practice does two things:
1)It helps us to acquire the skills that speed up/automate processes and feedback.
2)It pushes us to the edge of our competence and forces us to focus. This is where the learning happens.</p>

<p>我们看到的是自己想看到的世界，心智模式是一套大脑的内部程序。
我们按照自己过去的经验和记忆，处理我们看到的部分世界，然后在我们脑子里面构建一个自己的世界。这是我们大脑的工作原理。
即使生活在一模一样的世界的，我们对世界也会有完全不同的认识。正所谓“仁者见仁，智者见智”，“色即是空，空即是色”。</p>
<p>人们会变成自己觉得“应该成为”的人。
幸运儿反复印证自己的“幸运儿模式”，从而更加相信自己的“幸运世界”，而倒霉蛋则对自己的“倒霉世界”坚信不移。</p>
<p>我们为自己构建了一个世界，然后又反复强化，最终让我们相信这个世界就是我们构建的那样。
从这个角度说，每个人都是自己生命的巫师，你渴望什么，就会获得什么。</p>
<p>每一种心智模式背后都有相应的对世界的假定，也有着相对的局限性。外界变化了，心智模式就要改变，思维方法和心态也要变化。
共赢模式有着关键的外界假设：世界有富足的资源来支持每一个人，同时双方需要有不止一次的交易。如果没有了这两种条件，也许双输模式和输赢模式会是更好的选择。</p>
<p>心智模式无所谓对错，只有是否有效之分。</p>
<p>我们过去的体验、经历、受到的教育和社会环境，决定了我们的心智模式，而心智模式又在改变我们未来的命运。
虽然我们不能改变过去的事实，我们却能改变对于我们过去的看法，这才是心智模式的伟大之处。
所以我们必须找到内心世界中柔软的可以改变的部分，然后通过自己的观察和思考重新塑造我们更加喜欢的世界。</p>
<p>不知不觉 → 后知后觉 → 当知当觉 → 先知先觉
混沌——察觉——醒觉——超越四个步骤，是心智模式升级的必经之路。</p>
<p>每一个人都应该重新审视自己的心智模式，这些模式决定我们看到些什么，感受到些什么，如何思考以及最终成为怎么样的人。
心态由关于世界的不同假设而决定，是心智模式运算的结果。如果希望保持某种心态，就一定要明白心态背后的心智模式。
人们总说优秀是一种习惯，其实优秀是一套心智模式。</p>
<p>一个心智模式一旦启动，你几乎可以预见它的结果。</p>
<p>受害者模式：习惯把痛苦和快乐放在别人手上，从外界找原因，推卸责任，活在让自己舒服的自怜状态，却失去了掌控生活的机会和可能性。
掌控者模式：不管外界怎么样，我都有能力对自己的状况负责，需要面临一些压力和面子问题，却可以掌控自己的生活。
你愿意坚强地掌控，还是愿意自怜地受害？</p>
<p>坚持或放弃都是达到目标的手段，坚持的是结果，放弃的是方式。
大部分的失败与冲突，就是因为在坚持自己的形式，而不是结果。</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#思维升级" id="思维升级"><h1>思维升级</h1></a>
<p>普通人的思维是： 问题 → 一般解</p>
<p>升级后的思维是： 问题 → 可能解 → 最优解</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#学习" id="学习"><h1>学习</h1></a>
<p>学习应该少而精，而非多而浅。</p>
<p>要想克服知行差距的第一个秘诀就是要努力做到少而精——将精力集中到少数几件事上，然后不断地一次又一次的重复。专注、专注。</p>
<p>通过间隔性重复彻底读透少量资料对你的心理所产生的影响，要超过泛读 (只读一次)20 本书所产生的影响。</p>
<p>当一个人从 “知道一件事” 到 “做这件事” 的过程中，一共要经历 3 个层次的转变，第一个是知识层次的转变。第二个是态度上的转变。第三个层次的转变，也是最为困难的变化层次，是行为上的变化。</p>
<p>让自己成长的最好方式——带着一种开放而积极的心态去聆听、去学习。积极的过滤系统可以激发你的创造力和应变力。</p>
<p>越快实际应用一种新学会的技巧，你就越容易掌握它。要想得到自己想要的结果，将自己的知识付诸实践，你需要一个跟进计划来为你提供指导、支持，增强责任感。</p>
<p>如何将我们学到的知识变成做到呢？首先需要我们坚持少而精的原则，做最重要的事；之后，对待新事物保持好奇心，摒弃我们固有的发臭思维，引用绿灯思维，让我们的大脑进入新鲜空气；最后重要的是要制定一个跟进反馈系统，让我们有计划有反馈的做我们想做的事。然后不断的重复、重复、重复。</p>
