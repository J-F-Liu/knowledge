<a class="header" href="print.html#stage-one-mimicry-模仿阶段" name="stage-one-mimicry-模仿阶段"><h2>STAGE ONE: MIMICRY 模仿阶段</h2></a>
<p><strong>In Stage One, we learn to fit in with the people and culture around us.</strong>
The goal of Stage One is to teach us how to function within society so that we can be autonomous, self-sufficient adults.</p>
<p>As children, the way we’re wired to learn is by watching and mimicking others.
First we learn to do physical skills like walk and talk.
Then we develop social skills by watching and mimicking our peers around us.
Then, finally, in late childhood, we learn to adapt to our culture by observing the rules and norms around us and trying to behave in such a way that is generally considered acceptable by society.</p>
<p>In Stage One, a person is wholly dependent on other people’s actions and approval to be happy.
This is a horrible strategy because other people are unpredictable and unreliable.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#stage-two-self-discovery-自我发现阶段" name="stage-two-self-discovery-自我发现阶段"><h2>STAGE TWO: SELF-DISCOVERY 自我发现阶段</h2></a>
<p><strong>Stage Two is about learning what makes us different from the people and culture around us.</strong>
Stage Two requires us to begin making decisions for ourselves, to test ourselves, and to understand ourselves and what makes us unique.</p>
<p>Stage Two involves a lot of trial-and-error and experimentation. We experiment with living in new places, hanging out with new people, imbibing new substances, and playing with new people’s orifices.
At some point we all must admit the inevitable: life is short, not all of our dreams can come true, so we should carefully pick and choose what we have the best shot at and commit to it.</p>
<p>In Stage Two, one becomes reliant on oneself, but they’re still reliant on external success to be happy — making money, accolades, victory, conquests, etc.
These are more controllable than other people, but they are still mostly unpredictable in the long-run.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#stage-three-commitment-自我实现阶段" name="stage-three-commitment-自我实现阶段"><h2>STAGE THREE: COMMITMENT 自我实现阶段</h2></a>
<p>Stage Three is the great consolidation of one’s life. Stage Three is all about maximizing your own potential in this life.</p>
<p>It’s all about building your legacy. What will you leave behind when you’re gone? What will people remember you by?
Whether that’s a breakthrough study or an amazing new product or an adoring family, <strong>Stage Three is about leaving the world a little bit different than the way you found it.</strong></p>
<p>Stage Three relies on a handful of relationships and endeavors that proved themselves resilient and worthwhile through Stage Two. These are more reliable.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#stage-four-legacy-遗产保护阶段" name="stage-four-legacy-遗产保护阶段"><h2>STAGE FOUR: LEGACY 遗产保护阶段</h2></a>
<p>People arrive into Stage Four having spent somewhere around half a century investing themselves in what they believed was meaningful and important.</p>
<p>They did great things, worked hard, earned everything they have, maybe started a family or a charity or a political or cultural revolution or two, and now they’re done.
They’ve reached the age where their energy and circumstances no longer allow them to pursue their purpose any further.
The goal of Stage Four then becomes not to create a legacy as much as simply making sure that legacy lasts beyond one’s death.</p>
<p>As humans, we have a deep need to feel as though our lives mean something.
This meaning we constantly search for is literally our only psychological defense against the incomprehensibility of this life and the inevitability of our own death.</p>
<p><strong>Stage Four requires we only hold on to what we’ve already accomplished as long as possible.</strong></p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#how-to-enter-the-next-stage-怎样进入下一个阶段" name="how-to-enter-the-next-stage-怎样进入下一个阶段"><h2>How To Enter The Next Stage 怎样进入下一个阶段</h2></a>
<p>The same thing gets us stuck at every stage: a sense of personal inadequacy.</p>
<p>The solution at each stage is then backwards. To move beyond Stage One, you must accept that you will never be enough for everybody all the time, and therefore you must make decisions for yourself.</p>
<p>To move beyond Stage Two, you must accept that you will never be capable of accomplishing everything you can dream and desire, and therefore you must zero in on what matters most and commit to it.</p>
<p>To move beyond Stage Three, you must realize that time and energy are limited, and therefore you must refocus your attention to helping others take over the meaningful projects you began.</p>
<p>To move beyond Stage Four, you must realize that change is inevitable, and that the influence of one person, no matter how great, no matter how powerful, no matter how meaningful, will eventually dissipate too.</p>
<p>And life will go on.</p>
<p>At each subsequent stage, happiness becomes based more on internal, controllable values and less on the externalities of the ever-changing outside world. Later stages don’t replace previous stages. They transcend them.</p>
<p>Stage Two people still care about social approval. They just care about something more than social approval.</p>
<p>Stage Three people still care about testing their limits. They just care more about the commitments they’ve made.</p>
<p><strong>Each stage represents a reshuffling of one’s life priorities.</strong></p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#the-four-types-of-happy-lives-幸福的四个层次" name="the-four-types-of-happy-lives-幸福的四个层次"><h1>The Four Types Of Happy Lives 幸福的四个层次</h1></a>
<p>There are four types of happy lives, the lives get better — but more challenging.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#happy-life-1-the-pleasant-life-愉快的生活" name="happy-life-1-the-pleasant-life-愉快的生活"><h2>Happy Life #1: The Pleasant Life 愉快的生活</h2></a>
<blockquote>
<p>A life that successfully pursues the positive emotions about the present, past and future.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The goal is life as one long vacation. You want as many positive feelings and bodily pleasures as you can. Tasty food, aesthetic feeling, smiles, massages, and laughs. No regrets, no worries, and a head full of positive thoughts.</p>
<p>Research shows that often you don’t actually do what you enjoy the most — you do what is easiest. So you need to schedule pleasurable things.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#happy-life-2-the-good-life-美好的生活" name="happy-life-2-the-good-life-美好的生活"><h2>Happy Life #2: The Good Life 美好的生活</h2></a>
<blockquote>
<p>Using your signature strengths to obtain abundant gratification in the main realms of your life.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Actively doing stuff you’re good at and getting lost in it. Trying to improve your skills. Accomplishing goals and trying to achieve “flow” as much as possible.
Flow is when you’re working at something and you’re in the zone, not noticing the passage of time because you’re caught up in the activity.</p>
<p>While The Pleasant Life is all about feeling, The Good Life is focused on doing.
And much like The Pleasant Life, The Good Life can still be meaningless. Video games are great at creating flow and devoting yourself to becoming the best player of a game.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#happy-life-3-the-meaningful-life-有意义的生活" name="happy-life-3-the-meaningful-life-有意义的生活"><h2>Happy Life #3: The Meaningful Life 有意义的生活</h2></a>
<blockquote>
<p>Using your signature strengths and virtues in service of something larger than you are.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Meaningful Life is The Good Life — but you’re using your signature strengths in a way that benefits others as well as yourself.</p>
<p>Work of expert quality that benefits the broader society consistently exhibit high levels of job satisfaction.</p>
<p>You have to care to have meaning in your life. And that’s going to mean occasional un-pleasant feelings: Meaningful involvements increase one’s stress, worries, arguments, and anxiety, which reduce happiness.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#happy-life-4-the-full-life-完整的生活" name="happy-life-4-the-full-life-完整的生活"><h2>Happy Life #4: The Full Life 完整的生活</h2></a>
<blockquote>
<p>Take all of the previous three in moderation and you have The Full Life.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A full life consists in experiencing positive emotions about the past and future, savoring positive feelings from the pleasures,
deriving abundant gratification from your signature strengths, and using these strengths in the service of something larger to obtain meaning.</p>
<p>It requires you deeply committed to lifelong goals and ambitions. It can be a lot to juggle. It’s tricky to stay consistent. You have to find a balance that works for you.
But as the happiest people in the world know: it’s worth it.</p>
