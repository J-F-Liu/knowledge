# Becoming Successful 走向成功

Don’t aim at success. The more you aim at it and make it a target, the more you are going to miss it.
For success, like happiness, cannot be pursued; it must ensue, you have to let it happen by not caring about it.
I want you to listen to what your conscience commands you to do and go on to carry it out to the best of your knowledge.
Then you will live to see that in the long-run, success will follow you precisely because you had forgotten to think about it.

I know so many people who chase whatever worked for other people.
Those who are going to succeed will decide what they want to do regardless of what everyone else says or thinks about it.

## Believe in life-long learning. 终身学习
One of the best ways to gain knowledge and be better is self-education.
As long as you are genuinely interested in the topic, don’t stop.
Lifelong learning will get most of your questions answered.
Make the most of your time and improve yourself every day.

The ability to expand your mind and strive for lifelong learning is more critical to your success than you think.
Every skill you acquire doubles your odds of success. 
Begin to plant seeds every day that will yield the best and most fulfilling life now and in the future.

Research has proven that more than ever before, a challenged, stimulated brain may well be the key to a vibrant later life.
Studies have found that learning throughout our lives can improve self-esteem and increase life-satisfaction, optimism and belief in our own abilities.

## Leverage Your Position. 立足现状
There are people you already know who have information you need.
There are people you already know who have capital you can use.
There are people you already know who can connect you with people you should know.
Instead of wanting more, how about you utilize what you already have? Until you do, more won’t help you.

Success is based on having and maintaining a motivation worth fighting for.
It’s based on believing what others might call a fantasy.
It’s based on leveraging your position and maintaining the momentum of every step you take.

## Begin with the end clearly in mind. 以终为始
People may spend their whole lives climbing the ladder of success only to find, once they reach the top, that the ladder is leaning against the wrong wall.

Too many people are playing the wrong game. It’s how you ruin your life without even knowing it.
More important than playing “the game” is how the game is set up. How you set up the game determines how you play. And it’s better to win first, then play.

Start from the end and work backwards. Rather than thinking about what’s plausible, or what’s expected, or what makes sense — start with what you want.

## Don’t Wait To Start. 立即行动
You qualify yourself by showing up and working. You get permission by deciding.

Life is short. Don’t wait for tomorrow for something you could do today.

## Take one step at a time. 走一步看一步
When you’re trying to accomplish something big, you have the why but rarely the how. The path to achieving your goals is far from obvious.
The emotional need for clarity and fear of the unknown leads people to abandon their dreams for more straightforward pursuits.
However you don't need to have “it all” figured it. You need clarity on the next step or two.
When you get to the next step, you’ll be able to ask better questions.

## Create As You See Fit. 以自己的方式做事
There is no right or wrong way. Rather, it’s about doing things your way.
You’ll emerge with your own voice and original work. You’ll be less troubled about how your work is received and more focused on creating something you believe in.

## Don’t Fear To Break Convention. 敢于打破常规
Convention is where we’re at. Breaking convention is how we’ll evolve, which requires a gargantuan quantity of failure.

Failure is feedback. Failure is moving forward. It’s conscious and exerted effort toward something you’ve never done before. It’s incredible.

## Never Forget Where You Came From. 不忘根本
It’s easy to forget where you came from.
It’s easy to forget all the sacrifices other people have made to get you where you are.
Humility, gratitude, and recognition of your blessings keeps your success in proper perspective.

## No One Succeeds Alone. 没有人能独自成功
"Find Your Tribe" — No matter how talented, how successful, how brilliant you are, just remember: Nobody wins alone.

You cannot be successful in a big way alone. You need help. You need an audience. It does not matter what your dream is.
You can only maximise your strengths and where you fall short, you need others’ strengths to create something truly amazing.
Nobody exists in a vacuum — and nobody succeeds in one either.

Pay very close attention to the people around you.
We don’t live and work in isolation, and when you can take advantage of the wisdom and even failings of those around you, the climb toward success is made that much easier.
Are you surrounding yourself with the right people? Are you putting yourself in the right environment? Are you getting inspired and challenged by the best people?
You can be the reason others receive inspiration. Show your best work every day!

## Becoming an Expert: The Elements of Success. 成为专家
If you study the life and work trajectory of experts, two patterns seem to emerge.
One, they have specific backgrounds or opportunities, as mentioned above. Two, they put an incredible amount of time and effort into deliberate, effortful practice.

The best type of practice does two things:
1)It helps us to acquire the skills that speed up/automate processes and feedback.
2)It pushes us to the edge of our competence and forces us to focus. This is where the learning happens.

## It takes longer than you think to succeed.
The overnight success is a myth.
Nothing worthwhile is going to be fast. Nor is building a business.
It takes longer than you think to adjust your product or service to the market’s needs and spread the word about your solution.

## Great ideas require great teams.
No one has ever built great things alone.

Your brilliant idea is not worth a dime. In today’s competitive environment, no one cares about the ideas. Everyone has tons of them.

The only thing people care about is execution. They no longer want to listen to fancy presentations and pitches of your concept. They want to see its implementation instead.

However, when it comes to implementation, you are likely to face the natural constraints of own knowledge, ideas, skills, and time. Your idea requires a team to help you bring it to life.

Every huge thing is a product of efficient collaboration. Don’t try to prove it wrong. Nothing worthwhile has ever been built alone.

## Don’t avoid the truth. Embrace it.

想要知道什么样的人的比较容易成功，我们绝对不能只看成功者，还要看那些不成功的人。
现在公认的几个能够区别成功人士和失败者的特质有如下几个，它们都是通过同时采样成功人士和不成功人士对比找到的：

- 良好的家庭教育 (从统计意义上说，成功者的家教普遍良好而很多不成功者的家庭教育普遍缺失)

- 良好的判断力 (从统计意义上说，成功者在诸多关键点上判断正确而很多不成功者在关键地方选择错误)

- 良好的自控力 (从统计意义上说，成功者普遍具有较好的自控力而很多失败者自控力较差)

- 良好的人际关系 (从统计意义上说，成功者的人际关系要好于未成功者)，以及很重要的，

- 好运气 (成功者赶上了好时代，以及出乎意料的好运气，而很多失败者之所以失败，是运气不好而已)
