A virtual machine (VM) is an emulation of a computer system.
An emulator is hardware or software that enables one computer system (called the host) to behave like another computer system (called the guest). 
Video game enthusiasts use emulators to play 1980s arcade games using the original 1980s programming code, which is interpreted by a current-era system.

Emulation focuses on recreating an original computer environment, which can be time-consuming and difficult to achieve, but valuable because of its ability to maintain a closer connection to the authenticity of the digital object. Potentially additional features original hardware didn't have.

This is especially useful when the original system is difficult to obtain, this should not only apply to out of date systems, but also be upwardly mobile to future unknown systems.

In many cases, the goal of emulation in new media art is to preserve a digital medium so that it can be saved indefinitely and reproduced without error, so that there is no reliance on hardware that ages and becomes obsolete. The paradox is that the emulation and the emulator have to be made to work on future computers.

Emulation techniques are commonly used during the design and development of new systems. It eases the development process by providing the ability to detect, recreate and repair flaws in the design even before the system is actually built. This also allows the software development to take place before the hardware is ready, thus helping to validate design decisions.

## CHIP-8, mid-1970s

- 16 8-bit data registers, address register is 16 bits
- 2 timers, for delay and sound, both count down at 60 hertz
- monochrome 64Ã—32 pixels Display
- beeping sound when sound timer is nonzero
- input keyboard has 16 keys
- 35 16-bit opcodes, support math and logic operations, control flow, graphics and sound

## Super Chip (or SCHIP), 1991
- 128x64 resolution
- higher speed in extended mode
- instructions to scroll the screen down, left, and right
