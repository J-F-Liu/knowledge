像奴隶一样工作，像国王一样命令，像神一样创造。（康斯坦丁·布朗库西，1876年－1957年，现代主义雕塑先驱）

As a developer, we always like to choose the best thing among several choices available.

The code editor is an application that enables the programmer to write and manipulate the source code.

IDE stands for Integrated Development Environment. It is a Graphical User Interface (GUI) based software which allows the programmers to write, debug, release, and deploy their code.

Syntax highlighting means that the editor displays the text, more specifically, the source code in different colors according to the programming language being used.

Debugging is the process of finding and removing bugs from a program.
