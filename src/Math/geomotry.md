# 几何 Geometry

Use what you know to find what you don’t know. And if you don’t have what you need, add it!
There’s sometimes more than one way to solve a problem, pick the way that seems like the least amount of work!

## 几何术语 geometry terms, geometry jargon

直线 straight line
线段 line segement

A line goes on forever in both directions. A line segment is just a bit of a line with a start and an end.

直角 right angle
平角 half turn
周角 whole turn

Angles can be made up of other, smaller angles.
Angles on a straight line add up to 180°.
Angles in a triangle add up to 180°.
Angles in a four-sided shape add up to 360°.

锐角 acute angle
钝角 obtuse angle
余角 complement angle
补角 supplementary angle

If two angles add up to 90°, they are complement.
If two angles add up to 180°, they are supplementary.

对顶角 vertical angles
平行线 parallel lines
垂线 perpendicular line
二等分 bisect

Vertically opposite angles are always equal.

Parallel lines are lines at exactly the same angle, parallel lines can never cross each other, the distance between the lines is constant.

When you have a line which crosses a set of parallel lines, all the sets of (opposite) vertical angles that are created are the same.

周长 perimeter
面积 area

The perimeter is the total length of the sides of a shape.

### Sketch

- A square mark indicates a right angle.
- Tick marks indicate equal angles.
- V-shaped tick marks indicate sets of parallel lines or line segments.

In geometry, unless you’re specifically told to measure an angle, assume that the drawing isn’t accurate, but that the numbers on the sketch are. We calculate missing angles rather than measure them.

You can add parallel or perpendicular lines to your sketch to break down the missing angles into parts you have the tools to find.

### Diagram

Sketches can help you think, but an accurate drawing can also show you whether something is possible or impossible.

- Grid paper gives you a head start.
- Use a ruler for more accurate drawings.

### Model

- Use your brain to imagine.
- Use logic to prove something works or doesn’t work.
- Use kids’ toys, a scrap piece of wood, or make models out of cardboard to put your theories to the test.
- A computer model lets you test out stuff as if it was in the real world.

Geometry rules work with all these methods, you’ll get the same results however you approach it.

### 相似 Similar

If two shapes are similar, then they don’t just look alike, one is an exact scaled version of the other. This means that they have the same (equal) angles. Similarity is maintained even if your shape is reflected or rotated.

- Similar shapes have equal angles.
- Similar shapes have the same ratios between side lengths.
- Some shapes are always similar. All circles are similar. All squares are similar.

A ratio captures the proportions of a shape, and then by using a different factor, we can create a similar shape of any size.

### 全等 Congruent

Tow shapes are congruent if they're similar and also the same size.

## 三角形 triangle

直角三角形 right triangle
等边三角形 equilateral triangle
等腰三角形 isosceles triangle
不等边三角形 scalene triangle

高线 altitude
垂足 foot of perpendicular
中线 median
中点 midpoint
底边 base
斜边 hypotenuse
顶角 apex angle
内角 internal angle

The height comes from the attidude of the triangle —— it's perpendicular to the base.
Medians are lines from the midpoint of a side to the opposite vertex.

### 毕达哥拉斯定理 The Pythagorean Theorem

The sum of the squares of the legs of a right triangle is equal to the square of the hypotenuse.

勾股数/毕氏三元数 pythagorean triple
整数解：(3,4,5), (5,12,13), (7,24,25), (8,15,17), (9,40,41), (11,60,61), (12,35,37)

### 三角形的五心

重心 centroid
垂心 orthocenter
内心 incenter
外心 circumcenter
The centroid is the intersection of all three medians.
The orthocenter is the intersection of the altitudes drawn on all three sides.
The incenter is the center of the biggest circle you can draw inside the triangle.
The circumcenter is the center of the smallest circle you can draw around the outside of a triangle.

三角形的重心，外心，垂心，内心和旁心称之为三角形的五心。
三角形的三条边的中线交于一点，该点叫做三角形的重心。重心和三角形任意两个顶点组成的3个三角形面积相等。
三角形的三条高线交于一点，该点叫做三角形的垂心。
三角形内切圆的圆心，叫做三角形的内心。三条内角平分线交于内心。内心到三条边的距离相等。
三角形外接圆的圆心，叫做三角形的外心。三条边的垂直平分线交于外心。外心到三个顶点的距离相等。
三角形的旁切圆（与三角形的一边和其他两边的延长线相切的圆）的圆心，叫做三角形的旁心。每个三角形都有三个旁心。

重心和内心总是在三角形内，外心和垂心可能在三角形的外面(有钝角时)，旁心一定在三角形外。
只有等边三角形才有中心，这时重心，内心，外心，垂心，四心合一。

## 面积

The area of a triangle is half the area of the bounding rectangle.

$$ 长方形面积 = 长 \times 宽 $$

$$ 三角形面积 = \frac{1}{2} \times 底 \times 高 $$

$$ 梯形面积 = \frac{1}{2} \times (上底 + 下底) \times 高 $$

Heron’s formula lets you find the area of a triangle when you only know the sides.
三角形面积的海伦公式：$ A = \sqrt{s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)}, s=\frac{a+b+c}{2} $

等边三角形的面积： $ A = \frac{\sqrt 3}{4} a^2 $

圆内接四边形面积：$ A = \sqrt{s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)(s-d)}, s=\frac{a+b+c+d}{2} $

When you needed to find the total area of a shape you were unfamiliar with, you split your shape up into other simpler shapes you were more familiar with.

## 圆 circle

直径 diameter
半径 radius
扇形 sector
圆弧 arc
外接圆 circumcircle
内切圆 incircle

The diameter of a circle is the distance from one side to the other, passing through the center.
The radius is the distance from the center to any point on the edge. Diameter is always two times the radius.
When a circle is divided up using lines that pass through the center of the circle, the resulting shapes are called sectors.
An arc is a section of the circumference, you can use the sector angle to find out the arc's length or area.

A circle’s perimeter is called the circumference, it equals multiplying the diameter by the number Pi.
Pi is really nothing more than a placeholder for the ratio between a circle’s circumference and its diameter.
π = 3.1415926535897932384626433832795…

三角形的面积是½底×高，圆可以看作是无数个小三角形组成的，高是半径，总的底是圆的周长，所以圆面积=½圆的周长×半径=½τr²。
τ = 2π = 6.28318530717958647692…

## 四边形 quadrilateral

正方形 square
长方形 rectangle
平行四边形 parallelogram
筝形 kite
菱形 rhombus
梯形 trapezoid
等腰梯形 isosceles trapezoid
直角梯形 right-angled trapezoid

![](./images/quadrilateral.png)

A quadrilateral is a flat shap with four straight sides.
A parallelogram is a four-sided shape whose opposite sides are parallel to each other.
A rectangle is a parallelogram and each of the four corners forms a right angle.
A square is a rectangle and four sides are all the same length.
A rhombus is quadrilateral where all four sides are the same length.

A kite has two pairs of adjacent congruent sides.
①两组邻边分别相等的四边形是筝形，但四边不等长。
②有一条对角线垂直平分另一条对角线的四边形是筝形。

A trapezoid has exactly one pair of opposite parallel sides.
An isosceles trapezoid is a trapezoid with congruent legs.
Trapezoid Area = height × (upper base + bottom base) / 2

对角线 diagonal
A diagonal is a straight line that connects one corner to the corner opposite.

Parallelogram Area = Base Width × Height

两条对角线垂直的四边形面积等于对角线长度的乘积除以2。
两条对角线夹角为θ，长度为p和q，四边形面积为 $ A = \frac{1}{2} pq \cdot\sinθ $。

练习题：如果一个长方形与某个正方形的周长和面积都相等，那么这个长方形也是个正方形。

## 多边形 polygon

正多边形 regular polygon
六边形 hexagon
七边形 septagon
八边形 octagon
九边形 nonagon

All the sides on a regular polygon are the same length, then all the angles are equal too.
A circle is just a regular polygon with infinite sides.

外接圆半径 circumradius
边心距 apothem

The radius of the circumcircle of a polygon is the polygon’s circumradius, and the radius of the incircle is called the polygon’s apothem.

- The apothem joins the center to the middle of a side, bisecting it.
- The apothem meets the side at a right angle.
- The circumradius joins the center to a vertex.
- The circumradius bisects the internal angle.

Polygon area = 1/2 perimeter x apothem

面积一定的情况下，边心距越短，周长越大，三角形的周长最大。周长一定的情况下，边心距越长，面积越大，圆的面积最大。

Volume of a cube = length x width x depth
