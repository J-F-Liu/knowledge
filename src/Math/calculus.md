# 微积分 calculus

Calculus is one of the pillars of modern science.

The secret in understanding calculus lies in knowing which quantities may be neglected and which may not.

A cable suspended from two towers is in the shape of a catenary, but when a horizontal roadway is suspended from the cable, the cable takes the shape of a parabola.

Constant Function: $$f(x) = b$$
Identity Function: $$f(x) = x$$
Reciprocal Function: $$f(x) = \frac{1}{x}$$
Square Function: $$f(x) = x²$$
Cube Function: $$f(x) = x³$$
Square Root Function: $$f(x) = \sqrt x$$
Cube Root Function: $$f(x) = \sqrt[3]{x}$$
Absolute Value Function: $$f(x) = |x|$$
Greatest Integer Function: $$f(x) = ⌈x⌉$$
Exponential Function: $$f(x)=Ca^x, a>0, a≠1, C≠0$$
The exponential function: $$f(x)=e^x$$
Logarithmic function: $$f(x) = \log_ax$$
Natural logarithm function: $$f(x) = \ln x$$
Common logarithm function: $$f(x) = \lg x$$
Logistic model: $$f(x) = \frac{c}{1+ae^{-bx}}$$
Sigmoid function: $$f(x) = \frac{1}{1+e^{-x}}$$
Transforms: $$f(x) = af(b(x+c))+d$$
Vertical or Horizontal shifts: $$f(x) = f(x+h)+k$$
Compressing or stretching vertically or horizontally: $$f(x) = af(bx)$$
