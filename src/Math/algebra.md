“In mathematics you don’t understand things, you just get used to them.”

“在数学中，你不是去理解它们，而只是去习惯它们而已”

-- 冯诺依曼

所有的数学结构都可以用几何图形表示。这种一一对应关系是通过某种数学规则来构建起来的。这是一种拓扑学的关系，叫做“同构”或“同胚”。

数轴是“数”与“几何”相结合的一个典型，一条直线与整个实数域，是存在一一对应关系的，即“实数集与直线是同构的”。

两个数字的组合是二维平面空间中的一点，3 个数字的组合是 3 维立体空间中的一点，而 n 个数字的组合，则是 n 维空间中的一点。而这一组数字的变化，就是 n 维空间中一个点的移动。这个点移动所扫过的轨迹，就是 n 为空间中的一条曲线，代表了这个点的运动历史。

# 代数 Algebra

Algebra is all about making unknowns known.

整数 Integers - The whole numbers, including all of the negative numbers, zero, and positive numbers.

循环小数 Repeating decimals
无限不循环小数 Non-terminating, non-repeating decimals
假分数 Improper fractions

Addition is move left on the number line for negative numbers, move right for positive numbers.

Dividend ÷ Divisor = Solution

Mathematically speaking, division by zero is undefined. That means that there is no answer.

Exponent - A superscript notation that indicates multiplication of the base that many times. Exponents are shorthand for repetitive multiplication.

The absolute value of a number is the value of the number without its sign. Absolute value is always positive; it’s the distance from zero to the number. Absolute value means caring about the distance, not the sign.

有理数 Rational Numbers - Any number that can be written as a fraction.
无理数 Irrational Numbers - Any number that can’t be written as a fraction.
实数 Real Numbers - All of the rational and irrational numbers.

Algebra starts with numbers. Algebra is about solving for unknowns. Algebra is about finding the missing information that you’re looking for by using the information you already have. Using tricks like writing the problem out with words and flipping things around are just ways to make finding that unknown possible.

方程 equation
未知数 unknown
变量 variable
常量 constant

Equations are math sentences, they’re a mathematical way of saying something. You use other information from your problem to setup an equation with the unknown.

x is just a user-friendly stand-in for the unknown, when translating problems into mathematical equations. You can use any letter that you want, though. The unknown is called a variable. Multiplying a number by a variable is so common that just writing them next to each other is a lot less confusing than having a multiplication symbol in between.

If you have constants in your problem, you can use the actual number or use a letter to stand in for it, if that makes things easier. A constant can also be used to describe an unknown in an equation that represents a number that doesn’t change. Constants are great for turning specific problems into more general ones because we can use letters instead of specific numbers.

An equals sign means that both sides are the same. When you do something to one side of the equation, you have to do the same thing to the other side of the equation to preserve the equality.

Isolating the variable means you’ve gotten the variable by itself on the left side of the equation and everything else stacked up over on the right, then you’ve solved the equation.

The basic math operations are addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Exponents are a way of repeating multiplication.

An inverse operation is the operation that undoes an operation (like addition undoes subtraction). Addition is the inverse of subtraction, and multiplication is the inverse of division. Root is the inverse of exponent.

Inverse operations let you shift a number or variable from one side of the equation to the other by “undoing” that number on one side of an equation. Inverse operations help you isolate the variable.

Substitution means putting something in for something else. To check your work, you substitute in the answer you found for the variable in the original equation.

When we get to more complex equations, and equations with more than one variable, you’ll want to use substitution as part of the solving process.

1. Understand the problem statement. You need to fully understand a problem before you do anything else. Each problem will come with hints and an unknown. Figure out what you’re looking for and what other numbers in the problem will help you solve it. Think of it verbally first.

2. Write the equation to solve it. Once you understand what you need to find, write out the equation in algebraic form.

3. Figure out how to isolate the variable. Use inverse operations and work the arithmetic when you have actual numbers to get the variable by itself on one side of the equation.

4. Manipulate the equation. Apply your techniques to actually move the numbers around in the equation to get that variable by itself. Make sure you always keep the equation equal by doing the same thing to both sides.

5. Rewrite the equation. Clean up the equation by performing any arithmetic you’ve setup after you moved things around and see if you’ve gotten the variable by itself. If not, apply another technique to get the variable by itself.

6. Write the equation as unknown = number. Once you’ve gotten the variable by itself, you’ve found the solution!

7. Check your work!! Check that you have the right answer by plugging your number back into the original problem in place of the unknown.

8. Always think about the context of the problem. You may need to round down to the nearest whole number.

When you’ve got more than one way to solve an equation, look for the SIMPLEST way to work with your equation. A big part of mathematics is that there are different ways to solve problems and still arrive at the same (correct) answer.

Algebra is about solving for an unknown, but it’s also about making smart choices about how to get to that solution.

项 term
同类项 like term
表达式 expression
运算 operation

A term is a piece of equation that is held together with multiplication or division. Follow the order of operations to combine like terms.

A single equation in two variables can not be solved, you need an additional relationship which express one vairiable in terms of some other variable.

运算规则 operation rules

运算顺序 order of operations

The order you’re supposed to work with numbers in a math expression is called the order of operations.

PEMDAS
P Parentheses or Brackets first
E Exponents (Powers and Roots)
MD Multiplication and Division (left-to-right)
AS Addition and Subtraction (left-to-right)

The strongest operations go first. Parentheses are a way to say, “Do this first!” Then, exponents and roots, and then multiplication and division. Finally, addition and subtraction. And we work on what’s left by moving from left to right because that’s the way we read.

In the case of a fraction, you’re not changing the value of the number, just how it’s expressed (1/2 vs. 0.5), so you can work with it either way.

It’s a good idea to write down what your expression looks like at each step. You can keep track of what you did and check your work.

运算性质 properties

Properties like the associative and commutative properties are really just another type of rule, and you can apply these properties before, during, or after applying the order of operations.

The Commutative Property - Changing the order that terms are added or multiplied does not change the outcome of the operation.

The Associative Property - Changing the groupings of a set of terms being added or multiplied does not change the outcome of the operation.

The Distributive Property - Distributing a value over a grouping doesn’t change an expression’s value.

The commutative property lets you reorder items in an equation. The distributive property helps spread multiplication and division out across the equation or pull it together into a single term. Properties help you work through an expression in the easiest, fastest way.

A general equation is just a way to remember rules that apply to all numbers in a certain situation.

$$
a + b = b + a \\
a \cdot b = b \cdot a \\
a + (b + c) = (a + b) + c \\
a (b \cdot c) = (a \cdot b) c \\
a (b + c) = ab + ac
$$

分子 numerator
分母 denominator
指数 exponent
根号 radical
根 root

Exponents are shorthand for repetitive multiplication. The base is the number that gets multiplied. The exponent is how many times the base is multiplied.

$$
x^ax^b = x^{a+b} \\
\cfrac{x^a}{x^b} = x^{a-b} \\
(x^a)^b = x^{ab} \\
x^ay^a = (xy)^a \\
\cfrac{x^a}{y^a} = (\cfrac{x}{y})^a \\
x^{-a} = \cfrac{1}{x^a} \\
x^0 = 1 \\
x^1 = x
\end{array}
$$

Negative exponents mean you can get rid of fractions.

Principle root is the positive root of a value. There are other roots to numbers, too, though. The most common is the negative root.

## Graph

A graph and an equation are just different ways of looking at a relationship between two variables. Graph is a visual representation of your equation. With graphs, you can make smart decisions with your equations.

Graphs show an ENTIRE relationship. A graph allows you to draw all of the possible points for an equation and then look up different points as you need them.

Each point was actually an ordered pair: one number followed by another number.

The typical variables for a graph are x for the horizontal axis, and y for the vertical axis.

A linear equation is an equation that defines a line.
The line that represents a linear equation has points where it crosses the x-axis and y-axis, called intercepts.
Slope is defined as rise over run: $slope=\cfrac{rise}{run}$

point-slope form: $ y - y_1 = m (x - x_1) $
slope-intercept form: $ y = mx + b $
standard form: $ ax + by = c $

## 不等式 Inequalities

Statements using comparison symbols are called inequalities since it’s about two things not being equal.

Comparison symbols express different relationships:
\< less than
\> greater than
≤ less than or equal to
≥ greater than or equal to
≠ not equal to

An inequality is a lot more realistic in many situations. The big difference between an inequality and an equality is the MEANING of your ANSWER. With inequalities, a range of answers work. The answers that work with an inequality are called the solution set.

A solution set is all of the values that satisfy an expression.

Numbers are smaller as you go to the left of the number line, and they get bigger on the right.

If you multiply or divide by a negative number the inequality, flip the inequality symbol to reverse the relationship.

The uppermost or lower most value that solves the inequality is called a boundary.

You can visualize a solution set on a number line. You can change the SCALE on your number line without affecting the VALUES on that number line. Use whatever scale makes sense for YOUR particular inequality.

Graphing inequalities in two variables is like graphing equations, with some extra shading. The ordered pairs in the shaded region satisfy the inequality. Every pair is a solution!

## 方程组 Equation Group

A system of equations is a group of equations that can be treated as one problem.

If you have two unknowns you need two independent relationships to find the values of the unknowns. If the lines are the same line, the relationships are not independent.

Algebra is a tool to solve a problem you’re dealing with. So when you’re working with equations, you need to always keep the context of your problem in mind.

To solve a system of equations with graphing, the intersection of the graphs is the solution.

To solve a system of equations with two variables using the substitution method, solve one equation in terms of one variable, substitute it into the second equation, and solve for the only variable left.

The substitution method works because a system of equations is a set of equations with the same variables. If you can solve for one variable in terms of another variable, you can get a valid equation in terms of one variable.

The elimination method is the process of adding up or subtract both of the equations to make some variables disappear and then working with the resulting equation.

After you’ve eliminated and solved for one variable, use that value to solve for the other variable.

For 2 linear equations with 2 unknowns, you either have a single solution (intersect once), no solutions (don’t intersect), or infinite solutions (same line).

If two lines are parallel, so there’s no intersection. That means that there isn’t any one point that will satisfy both equations.

## 二项式 Binomial

A binomial is an expression that contains two algebraic terms.

To multiply two binomials, you need to apply the distributive property.

There are patterns that let you avoid lots of extra work.

Square pattern:
$(x+a)(x- a) =x^2-a^2$
$(x+a)^2 =x^2+2ax+a^2$

## 多项式 polynomial

Polynomial is any expression with multiple terms. Binomial is a special case of a polynomial.

### Factoring is the inverse of the distributive property.

A factor is a term that’s multiplied over an entire expression. Pulling out common factors from a term or group is called factoring. Factoring is, basically, the opposite of multiplying. And when you’re working with a group of terms, factoring is the opposite of distributing.

Factoring is a tool to help manipulate the equation.

### Zero Product Rule: any number or term multipled by zero is always zero.

If $a \cdot b = 0$, then $a = 0$ and/or $b = 0$.

Factoring to get an equation in the form of two terms multiplied together to equal zero means that you can use the ZPR to solve.

### 二次方程 Quadratic equation

A quadratic equation is any polynomial equation that has a degree of two; that just means that the largest exponent for any variable is two.
Quadratic equations can be used to address a whole new set of real world scenarios.
Quadratic equations have up to two solutions.
Quadratic equations need to be in standard form before you factor.

standard form: $ax^2+bx+c=0$

常用求解方法：
分解因式法 factoring
配方法 completing the square
公式法 quadratic formula: $x = \cfrac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$
判别式 discriminant: $ Δ = b^2 - 4ac$

IF Δ > 0, then there are 2 real solutions.
IF Δ = 0, then there is only one unique solution.
IF Δ < 0, then there are no real solutions.

### 抛物线 parabola

A parabola is the shape of a quadratic equation.
A graph lets us see values. If we had a graph, we could just read off points without having to run a bunch of calculations.

The vertex is either the top or the bottom of the parabola.
x-coordinate for the vertex is: $x =-\cfrac{b}{2a}$
The axis of symmetry is the vertical line that goes through the vertex of the parabola.

## 函数 function

定义域 domain
值域 range

In the real world, limits exist all the time. The input limits are the domain of the function. By limiting the numbers that can go into a function, we’re limiting the numbers that can come out of a function.

All functions have a domain, which is the set of valid inputs for the function. All of the valid outputs are called the range. The range actually provides the minimum and the maximum of the function.

A function is a relation where one input results in a single output. It can be represented as an equation or as a set of ordered pairs, and has both a domain and a range.

The process of determining a function’s outputs is called evaluating the function. So every time you plug in x, and solve for f(x), you’re evaluating the function for a certain input value.

### 关系 relation

Algebra is really about relations

A relation is the general way in which two sets of numbers go together, and they are usually represented as ordered pairs. There does not need to be a pattern in a relation: it can be totally random.

A function is always a relation, but relations are not always functions.

An equation is just a way to write an infinite number of ordered pairs. An equation is a function if and only if for each input there is a single output.

Constraints on functions allow you to be more realistic in the way math represents the world.

### 函数图象 graph a function

- Graphing functions is similar to graphing equations.

- To show the limits of a function, use a solid point for an “or equal to” inequality, and an open point for just a less than or greater than symbol.

- A graph shows the domain and range of a function or relation.

### 分段函数 piecewise function

When the function needs to have different values over different parts of the domain, is called a piecewise defined function. The domains typically don’t overlap.

To evaluate a piecewise function, just determine the domain that applies and evaluate the portion of the function that applies.

Piecewise functions allow you to express that different things are happening at different times.

群：集合+二元运算，满足：封闭性、结合律、单位元、逆元。通常称群上的二元运算为 “乘法”。

交换群：除了满足一般的群公理，运算还满足交换律的群。

整数在加法运算下成群，有理数(去除 0 后)在乘法运算下成群。

环：群+二元运算，满足：封闭性、结合律。

域：环的一中特例，群去除单位元后在另一种运算下也成群，两种运算分别称作域的 “加法” 和 “乘法”。

有理数、实数、复数在加法和乘法运算下都构成域。

群同构：存在两个群 A、B 之间的一个双射（即一一对应的映射）ϕ:A→B，满足 ϕ(a*b)=ϕ(a)×ϕ(b)，其中 a、b∈A，ϕ(a)、ϕ(b) 和 ϕ(a*b)∈B，\* 和 × 分别是群 A 和 B 的运算。

域同构：两个域上的 “加法” 群同构，并且去除 “加法” 单位元之后的两个域上的 “乘法” 群也要同构。

扩域：把某个域 F 中添加进一个或几个不属于这个域的元素，在不改变原来域的 “加法” 和 “乘法” 的条件下，按照域的定义形成的新域 E 被称为原来域的扩域，记为 E/F。

## 空间

“空间”是容纳运动的一个对象集合，而变换则规定了对应空间的运动。不管是什么空间，都必须容纳和支持在其中发生的符合规则的变换，比如拓扑空间中有拓扑变换，线性空间中有线性变换，仿射空间中有仿射变换。

如果在线形空间里面定义了范数，就成了赋范线性空间。赋范线性空间满足完备性，就成了巴那赫空间；赋范线性空间中定义角度，就有了内积空间，内积空间再满足完备性，就得到希尔伯特空间。

## 线性空间

线性空间中的任何一个对象，通过选取基和赋予坐标的办法，都可以表达为向量的形式。基的选取有多种办法，只要所选取的那一组基线性无关就可以。

- 最高次项不大于 n 次的多项式的全体构成一个线性空间
- 闭区间[a, b]上的 n 阶连续可微函数的全体，构成一个线性空间

在线性空间中选定基之后，向量刻画对象，矩阵刻画对象的变换，用矩阵与向量的乘法施加变换。所谓变换，其实就是空间里从一个点（元素/对象）到另一个点（元素/对象）的跃迁。矩阵是线性空间里的变换的描述。

描述一个三维对象只需要三维向量，但所有的计算机图形学变换矩阵都是 4 x 4 的。原因是在计算机图形学里应用的图形变换，实际上是在仿射空间而不是向量空间中进行的，而仿射变换的矩阵表示是 4 x 4 的。

一个点不仅可以变换到同一个线性空间中的另一个点，而且可以变换到另一个线性空间中的另一个点去。最常用、最有用的一种变换，是在同一个线性空间之内的线性变换。
只要变换前后都是线性空间中的对象，这个变换就一定是线性变换，也就一定可以用一个非奇异矩阵来描述。而能用一个非奇异矩阵去描述的一个变换，一定是一个线性变换。

选定一组基就是在线性空间里选定一个坐标系。选不同的基，会得到不同的矩阵，所有这些矩阵都是同一个线性变换的描述。
所谓相似矩阵，就是同一个线性变换的不同的描述矩阵。相似矩阵的本征值相同。

作为变换的矩阵，不但可以把线性空间中的一个点给变换到另一个点去，而且也能够把线性空间中的一个坐标系表换成另一个坐标系。而且，变换点与变换坐标系，具有异曲同工的效果。
固定坐标系中一个对象的变换等价于固定对象所处的坐标系变换，因为运动是相对的。

矩阵不仅可以作为线性变换的描述，而且可以作为一组基的描述。如果一组向量是彼此线性无关的话，那么它们就可以成为度量这个线性空间的一组基，成为一个坐标系。

Ma = b 的意思是：① 向量 a 经过矩阵 M 所描述的变换，变成了向量 b。② 坐标系 I 中的向量 b 在坐标系 M 中的坐标值为向量 a，即 Ma = Ib，M 本身是在 I 坐标系中度量出来的。

矩阵又是坐标系，又是变换。到底是坐标系，还是变换，已经说不清楚了，于是定义“矩阵就是由 m 行 n 列数放在一起组成的数学对象。”

一个变换的特征向量是这样一种向量，它经过这种特定的变换后保持方向不变，只是进行长度上的伸缩，Ax=λx。
而且 x 是特征向量的话，cx 也是特征向量(c 是标量且不为零)，所以所谓的特征向量不是一个向量而是一个向量族。
特征值只不过反映了特征向量在变换时的伸缩倍数而已，对一个变换而言，特征向量指明的方向才是更重要的、更本质的东西！

比如镜像对称变换的特征向量是它的对称轴，而旋转变换没有特征向量。

如果一个矩阵与一个对角矩阵相似，称这个矩阵可对角化。
n 维矩阵可对角化的充要条件是有 n 个线性无关的本征向量，对角矩阵由对应的本征值组成。
