Addition is move left on the number line for negative numbers, move right for positive numbers.

Dividend ÷ Divisor = Solution

Mathematically speaking, division by zero is undefined. That means that there is no answer.

Exponent - A superscript notation that indicates multiplication of the base that many times. Exponents are shorthand for repetitive multiplication.

The absolute value of a number is the value of the number without its sign. Absolute value is always positive; it’s the distance from zero to the number. Absolute value means caring about the distance, not the sign.

有理数 Rational Numbers - Any number that can be written as a fraction.
无理数 Irrational Numbers - Any number that can’t be written as a fraction.
实数 Real Numbers - All of the rational and irrational numbers.

Algebra starts with numbers. Algebra is about solving for unknowns. Algebra is about finding the missing information that you’re looking for by using the information you already have. Using tricks like writing the problem out with words and flipping things around are just ways to make finding that unknown possible.

Equations are math sentences, they’re a mathematical way of saying something. You use other information from your problem to setup an equation with the unknown.

x is just a user-friendly stand-in for the unknown, when translating problems into mathematical equations. You can use any letter that you want, though. The unknown is called a variable. Multiplying a number by a variable is so common that just writing them next to each other is a lot less confusing than having a multiplication symbol in between.

If you have constants in your problem, you can use the actual number or use a letter to stand in for it, if that makes things easier. A constant can also be used to describe an unknown in an equation that represents a number that doesn’t change. Constants are great for turning specific problems into more general ones because we can use letters instead of specific numbers.

An equals sign means that both sides are the same. When you do something to one side of the equation, you have to do the same thing to the other side of the equation to preserve the equality.

Isolating the variable means you’ve gotten the variable by itself on the left side of the equation and everything else stacked up over on the right, then you’ve solved the equation.

The basic math operations are addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Exponents are a way of repeating multiplication.

An inverse operation is the operation that undoes an operation (like addition undoes subtraction). Addition is the inverse of subtraction, and multiplication is the inverse of division. Root is the inverse of exponent.

Inverse operations let you shift a number or variable from one side of the equation to the other by “undoing” that number on one side of an equation. Inverse operations help you isolate the variable.

Substitution means putting something in for something else. To check your work, you substitute in the answer you found for the variable in the original equation.

When we get to more complex equations, and equations with more than one variable, you’ll want to use substitution as part of the solving process.

1. Understand the problem statement. You need to fully understand a problem before you do anything else. Each problem will come with hints and an unknown. Figure out what you’re looking for and what other numbers in the problem will help you solve it. Think of it verbally first.

2. Write the equation to solve it. Once you understand what you need to find, write out the equation in algebraic form.

3. Figure out how to isolate the variable. Use inverse operations and work the arithmetic when you have actual numbers to get the variable by itself on one side of the equation.

4. Manipulate the equation. Apply your techniques to actually move the numbers around in the equation to get that variable by itself. Make sure you always keep the equation equal by doing the same thing to both sides.

5. Rewrite the equation. Clean up the equation by performing any arithmetic you’ve setup after you moved things around and see if you’ve gotten the variable by itself. If not, apply another technique to get the variable by itself.

6. Write the equation as unknown = number. Once you’ve gotten the variable by itself, you’ve found the solution!

7. Check your work!! Check that you have the right answer by plugging your number back into the original problem in place of the unknown.

8. Always think about the context of the problem. You may need to round down to the nearest whole number.

When you’ve got more than one way to solve an equation, look for the SIMPLEST way to work with your equation. A big part of mathematics is that there are different ways to solve problems and still arrive at the same (correct) answer.

Algebra is about solving for an unknown, but it’s also about making smart choices about how to get to that solution.

项 term
同类项 like term
表达式 expression
运算 operation

A term is a piece of equation that is held together with multiplication or division. Follow the order of operations to combine like terms.

A single equation in two variables can not be solved, you need an additional relationship which express one vairiable in terms of some other variable.

运算规则 operation rules

运算顺序 order of operations

The order you’re supposed to work with numbers in a math expression is called the order of operations.

PEMDAS
P Parentheses or Brackets first
E Exponents (Powers and Roots)
MD Multiplication and Division (left-to-right)
AS Addition and Subtraction (left-to-right)

The strongest operations go first. Parentheses are a way to say, “Do this first!” Then, exponents and roots, and then multiplication and division. Finally, addition and subtraction. And we work on what’s left by moving from left to right because that’s the way we read.

In the case of a fraction, you’re not changing the value of the number, just how it’s expressed (1/2 vs. 0.5), so you can work with it either way.

It’s a good idea to write down what your expression looks like at each step. You can keep track of what you did and check your work.

运算性质 properties

Properties like the associative and commutative properties are really just another type of rule, and you can apply these properties before, during, or after applying the order of operations.

The Commutative Property - Changing the order that terms are added or multiplied does not change the outcome of the operation.

The Associative Property - Changing the groupings of a set of terms being added or multiplied does not change the outcome of the operation.

The Distributive Property - Distributing a value over a grouping doesn’t change an expression’s value.

The commutative property lets you reorder items in an equation. The distributive property helps spread multiplication and division out across the equation or pull it together into a single term. Properties help you work through an expression in the easiest, fastest way.

A general equation is just a way to remember rules that apply to all numbers in a certain situation.

$$
a + b = b + a \\
a \cdot b = b \cdot a \\
a + (b + c) = (a + b) + c \\
a (b \cdot c) = (a \cdot b) c \\
a (b + c) = ab + ac
$$

Exponents are shorthand for repetitive multiplication. The base is the number that gets multiplied. The exponent is how many times the base is multiplied.

$$\begin{array}{c}
x^ax^b = x^{a+b} \\
\cfrac{x^a}{x^b} = x^{a-b} \\
(x^a)^b = x^{ab} \\
x^ay^a = (xy)^a \\
\cfrac{x^a}{y^a} = (\cfrac{x}{y})^a \\
x^{-a} = \cfrac{1}{x^a} \\
x^0 = 1 \\
x^1 = x
\end{array}
$$

Negative exponents mean you can get rid of fractions.

Principle root is the positive root of a value. There are other roots to numbers, too, though. The most common is the negative root.

## Graph

A graph and an equation are just different ways of looking at a relationship between two variables. Graph is a visual representation of your equation. With graphs, you can make smart decisions with your equations.

Graphs show an ENTIRE relationship. A graph allows you to draw all of the possible points for an equation and then look up different points as you need them.

Each point was actually an ordered pair: one number followed by another number.

The typical variables for a graph are x for the horizontal axis, and y for the vertical axis.

A linear equation is an equation that defines a line.
The line that represents a linear equation has points where it crosses the x-axis and y-axis, called intercepts.
Slope is defined as rise over run: $slope=\cfrac{rise}{run}$

point-slope form: $ y - y_1 = m (x - x_1) $
slope-intercept form: $ y = mx + b $
standard form: $ ax + by = c $

## 不等式 Inequalities
Statements using comparison symbols are called inequalities since it’s about two things not being equal.

Comparison symbols express different relationships:
\< less than
\> greater than
≤ less than or equal to
≥ greater than or equal to
≠ not equal to

An inequality is a lot more realistic in many situations. The big difference between an inequality and an equality is the MEANING of your ANSWER. With inequalities, a range of answers work. The answers that work with an inequality are called the solution set.

A solution set is all of the values that satisfy an expression.

Numbers are smaller as you go to the left of the number line, and they get bigger on the right.

If you multiply or divide by a negative number the inequality, flip the inequality symbol to reverse the relationship.

The uppermost or lower most value that solves the inequality is called a boundary.

You can visualize a solution set on a number line. You can change the SCALE on your number line without affecting the VALUES on that number line. Use whatever scale makes sense for YOUR particular inequality.

Graphing inequalities in two variables is like graphing equations, with some extra shading. The ordered pairs in the shaded region satisfy the inequality. Every pair is a solution!

## 方程组 Equation Group

A system of equations is a group of equations that can be treated as one problem.

If you have two unknowns you need two independent relationships to find the values of the unknowns. If the lines are the same line, the relationships are not independent.

Algebra is a tool to solve a problem you’re dealing with. So when you’re working with equations, you need to always keep the context of your problem in mind.

To solve a system of equations with graphing, the intersection of the graphs is the solution.

To solve a system of equations with two variables using the substitution method, solve one equation in terms of one variable, substitute it into the second equation, and solve for the only variable left.

The substitution method works because a system of equations is a set of equations with the same variables. If you can solve for one variable in terms of another variable, you can get a valid equation in terms of one variable.

The elimination method is the process of adding up or subtract both of the equations to make some variables disappear and then working with the resulting equation.

After you’ve eliminated and solved for one variable, use that value to solve for the other variable.

For 2 linear equations with 2 unknowns, you either have a single solution (intersect once), no solutions (don’t intersect), or infinite solutions (same line).

If two lines are parallel, so there’s no intersection. That means that there isn’t any one point that will satisfy both equations.

## 二项式 Binomial

A binomial is an expression that contains two algebraic terms.

To multiply two binomials, you need to apply the distributive property.

There are patterns that let you avoid lots of extra work.

Square pattern:
$(x+a)(x- a) =x^2-a^2$
$(x+a)^2 =x^2+2ax+a^2$


## 多项式 polynomial

Polynomial is any expression with multiple terms. Binomial is a special case of a polynomial.

### Factoring is the inverse of the distributive property.

A factor is a term that’s multiplied over an entire expression. Pulling out common factors from a term or group is called factoring. Factoring is, basically, the opposite of multiplying. And when you’re working with a group of terms, factoring is the opposite of distributing.

Factoring is a tool to help manipulate the equation.

### Zero Product Rule: any number or term multipled by zero is always zero.

If $a \cdot b = 0$, then $a = 0$ and/or $b = 0$.

Factoring to get an equation in the form of two terms multiplied together to equal zero means that you can use the ZPR to solve.

### 二次方程 Quadratic equation
A quadratic equation is any polynomial equation that has a degree of two; that just means that the largest exponent for any variable is two.
Quadratic equations can be used to address a whole new set of real world scenarios.
Quadratic equations have up to two solutions.
Quadratic equations need to be in standard form before you factor.

standard form: $ax^2+bx+c=0$

常用求解方法：
分解因式法 factoring
配方法 completing the square
公式法 quadratic formula: $x = \cfrac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$
判别式 discriminant: $ Δ = b^2 - 4ac$

IF Δ > 0, then there are 2 real solutions.
IF Δ = 0, then there is only one unique solution.
IF Δ < 0, then there are no real solutions.

### 抛物线 parabola
A parabola is the shape of a quadratic equation.
A graph lets us see values. If we had a graph, we could just read off points without having to run a bunch of calculations.

The vertex is either the top or the bottom of the parabola.
x-coordinate for the vertex is: $x =-\cfrac{b}{2a}$
The axis of symmetry is the vertical line that goes through the vertex of the parabola.

## 函数 function

定义域 domain
值域 range

In the real world, limits exist all the time. The input limits are the domain of the function. By limiting the numbers that can go into a function, we’re limiting the numbers that can come out of a function.

All functions have a domain, which is the set of valid inputs for the function. All of the valid outputs are called the range. The range actually provides the minimum and the maximum of the function.

A function is a relation where one input results in a single output. It can be represented as an equation or as a set of ordered pairs, and has both a domain and a range.

The process of determining a function’s outputs is called evaluating the function. So every time you plug in x, and solve for f(x), you’re evaluating the function for a certain input value.

### 关系 relation

Algebra is really about relations

A relation is the general way in which two sets of numbers go together, and they are usually represented as ordered pairs. There does not need to be a pattern in a relation: it can be totally random.

A function is always a relation, but relations are not always functions.

An equation is just a way to write an infinite number of ordered pairs. An equation is a function if and only if for each input there is a single output.

Constraints on functions allow you to be more realistic in the way math represents the world.

### 函数图象 graph a function

- Graphing functions is similar to graphing equations.

- To show the limits of a function, use a solid point for an “or equal to” inequality, and an open point for just a less than or greater than symbol.

- A graph shows the domain and range of a function or relation.

### 分段函数 piecewise function

When the function needs to have different values over different parts of the domain, is called a piecewise defined function. The domains typically don’t overlap.

To evaluate a piecewise function, just determine the domain that applies and evaluate the portion of the function that applies.

Piecewise functions allow you to express that different things are happening at different times.
