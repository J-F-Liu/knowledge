## Be your best self. 做最好的自己
Be yourself; no base imitator of another, but your best self. There is something which you can do better than another.
Listen to the inward voice and bravely obey that. Do the things at which you are great, not what you were never made for.

Something you are happy to do without hesitation. Skills that are unique to you.
Skills you can only learn by doing; by learning how to fly after jumping off the cliff.

Invest in yourself, it’s the best investment you can ever make. Create a bigger version of yourself.
There is something about you that can be explored and developed to your benefit and the rest of the world.
The real world rewards those who get stuff done!

You have decided to ignore everybody and focus on building the life you deeply care about.
Don’t be afraid to expose your authentic self to the world, be creative about what you do.
Show your work. Don’t be afraid to show others what you are capable of.
Become immune to the impact of others’ opinion and stand naked in a crowd of ideas; comfortable in knowing that while others married the mundane, you explored the exceptional.

## Your thoughts decide your future. 你的想法决定你的未来
We attract into our lives by what we think and believe.
Writing out you are being who you want to be, which will then inform what you do and ultimately who you become.

No matter where you are right now, you can have any future you want.
Create the highest, grandest vision possible for your life, because you become what you believe.
Mental creation always precedes physical creation. The blueprint you design in your head becomes the life you build.

## Assume nothing but question everything. 怀疑一切
You desperate for knowledge or information that can be used to improve or create something.
While others waste time, you rather learn how to create, build or design something.
You are hungry to make a difference or do something significant.

## Don’t invest in a career. Build a life. 创造属于自己的人生
The way we work keeps changing. Robots are eating jobs. People are scared of losing their jobs. Nobody is safe. 
It’s easier to transform your passion into your job than finding a job that matches your what you love to do. 
Do something interesting, meaningful, different, amazing and truly remarkable. Show your most amazing work to the world.

## Take your dreams seriously. 认真对待你的梦想
If you pursue your dreams long enough, compounding takes effect. Momentum will surge. Don’t give up just yet.
For centuries we’ve been trained by the system to stop thinking and do as we are told.
But dreamers and thinkers are changing the world as we know it.

## Nothing is impossible. 一切皆有可能
You need to aim beyond what you are capable of.
You need to develop a complete disregard for where your abilities end.
Make your vision of where you want to be a reality.
