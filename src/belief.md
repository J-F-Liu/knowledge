# 信念

## Be your best self. 做最好的自己

Be yourself; no base imitator of another, but your best self. There is something which you can do better than another.
Listen to the inward voice and bravely obey that. Do the things at which you are great, not what you were never made for.

Something you are happy to do without hesitation. Skills that are unique to you.
Skills you can only learn by doing; by learning how to fly after jumping off the cliff.

Invest in yourself, it’s the best investment you can ever make. Create a bigger version of yourself.
There is something about you that can be explored and developed to your benefit and the rest of the world.
The real world rewards those who get stuff done!

You have decided to ignore everybody and focus on building the life you deeply care about.
Don’t be afraid to expose your authentic self to the world, be creative about what you do.
Show your work. Don’t be afraid to show others what you are capable of.
Become immune to the impact of others’ opinion and stand naked in a crowd of ideas; comfortable in knowing that while others married the mundane, you explored the exceptional.

## Your thoughts decide your future. 你的想法决定你的未来

We attract into our lives by what we think and believe.
Writing out you are being who you want to be, which will then inform what you do and ultimately who you become.

No matter where you are right now, you can have any future you want.
Create the highest, grandest vision possible for your life, because you become what you believe.
Mental creation always precedes physical creation. The blueprint you design in your head becomes the life you build.

## Don’t invest in a career. Build a life. 创造属于自己的人生

The way we work keeps changing. Robots are eating jobs. People are scared of losing their jobs. Nobody is safe.
It’s easier to transform your passion into your job than finding a job that matches your what you love to do.
Do something interesting, meaningful, different, amazing and truly remarkable. Show your most amazing work to the world.

## Take your dreams seriously. 认真对待你的梦想

If you pursue your dreams long enough, compounding takes effect. Momentum will surge. Don’t give up just yet.
For centuries we’ve been trained by the system to stop thinking and do as we are told.
But dreamers and thinkers are changing the world as we know it.

## Assume nothing but question everything. 怀疑一切

You desperate for knowledge or information that can be used to improve or create something.
While others waste time, you rather learn how to create, build or design something.
You are hungry to make a difference or do something significant.

## Nothing is impossible. 一切皆有可能

You need to aim beyond what you are capable of.
You need to develop a complete disregard for where your abilities end.
Make your vision of where you want to be a reality.

每一份工作，要做到最好，也许都要有超越工作本身之外的信念。

人必有痴，而后有成。（林语堂）

实现梦想的最大障碍并不是懒惰、意志力不足或没有时间，最大的障碍是我们内心的恐惧和自我偏见。

我们的信念似乎会影响很多事情：

- 信念影响动机。
- 信念影响压力。
- 信念影响我们的自控能力。
- 信念影响我们学习、改变的潜力（成长心态）。

自我限制信念（self-limiting belief） 是指那些你自认为是正确的、但却限制了你进步的信念。它可以表现为消极的自我暗示或对世界的悲观看法。

内心的恐惧也会产生类似的效果：阻止我们做自己想做的事情。恐惧的问题在于它们会撒谎、会逃避。

好消息是，信念是可以改变的。通过重塑信念来改变生活态度。

不要只相信真实的东西，而要相信有用的东西，甚至迷信也有帮助。
